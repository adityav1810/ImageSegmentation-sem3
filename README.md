# Undergrad Semester Project - Instance Segmentation 
This repository hosts the codebase for a semester group project that I led in my undergraduate years. The project hosts the MASK-RCNN model on a website providing users with no programming experience a way to interact and witness the power of AI. 
The website used a NodeJs backend linked to a python script that runs a prediction on the famous MASK-RCNN deep learning model. 

Instancify is an algorithm which provides a better understanding of an image by instantiating it. The algorithm uses instance algorithm segmentation via which we not only have the bounding box of the object as well as pixel-wise masks for each object, enabling us to segment and classify
each object individually.
We Use the MASK-RCNN Model proposed by Matterport Inc. as our backend model and have made a custom Website which allows users to input an image and as a result the instanciated image will be generated.
